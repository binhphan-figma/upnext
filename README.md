# UpNext

UpNext is an AI-powered IT recruitment platform for junior and mid-level hiring. The platform helps candidates improve their CVs and interview skills while helping recruiters screen applicants with transparent, human-in-the-loop AI support.

For the latest project handoff, run instructions, completed scope, and remaining work, see [`HANDOFF.md`](./HANDOFF.md). For the presentation guide, see [`DEFENSE.md`](./DEFENSE.md).

## Product positioning

UpNext is not a generic job board. It is a skills-based recruitment workflow where AI acts as:

1. a recruiter copilot,
2. a candidate coach,
3. a productivity layer for CV analysis, job matching, interview preparation, and hiring workflow.

AI never automatically rejects candidates. Recruiters remain final decision makers.

## Team recommendation

For a 5-member student team:

1. Frontend/public pages + UI system.
2. Candidate dashboard/profile/application flow.
3. Recruiter dashboard/job/applicant flow.
4. Backend/API/database/auth.
5. AI workflows/content/admin/testing.

Keep weekly integration demos. Do not let each member build isolated screens without shared data contracts.

## AI and ethics rules

- Do not infer or evaluate protected attributes.
- Store prompt version, model/provider, timestamp, and structured output.
